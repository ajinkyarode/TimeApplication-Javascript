# TimeApplication-Javascript

This Application was developed to practice and get hands on JavaScript, HTML and CSS

The goal is to implement simple application that performs basic time management for the employees of an organization.

The employees can perform different punch activities and certain conditions are implemented to perform time punches in a specific way to avoid any undesirable conditions using JavaScript.

The punch details are displayed once the user punches.

Instructions to open the application:
1) Extract the contents of the zip folder to a New Folder (or any folder, but place all files together)
2) Once extracted, open the Login.html file in Chrome browser (or any other browser)
3) The default credentials for the login are 'admin' and 'password'

Note: The application is entirely based on client side so executable file is not needed.
